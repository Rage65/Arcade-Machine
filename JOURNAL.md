## 10/18/2025 - installed linux on minipc and configured it  

So far I have installed batocera Linux on a minipc, and setup the configs for my controller, installed some games, and setup parental controls to prevent kids messing with settings.  Right now I am working on writing the code for the costom gamepad that is built into the cabinet. (sorry for low image res It was taken on my chromebook)
