## 10/18/2025 - installed linux on minipc and configured it  

So far I have installed batocera Linux on a minipc, and setup the configs for my controller, installed some games, and setup parental controls to prevent kids messing with settings.  Right now I am working on writing the code for the costom gamepad that is built into the cabinet. (sorry for low image res It was taken on my chromebook)

## 10/25/2025 - Wired up RGB lights and  made costom gamepad  

I wired up an RGB LED strip from an old strip light to a 12V PSU. Currently, I have R, G, and B tied to ground, so it's white, but soon I plan to have the colors controlled by the Raspberry Pi Pico, which also handles custom inputs. Speaking of custom input,s I wired up the rpi pico to some buttons and programmed it in circutpython to act as a keyboard via the HID library. Finally I attached the screen panel with ductape![IMG_1126.HEIC](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTQyNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--da0bac346e7a4a8f24637dc256c067f96d3b5abc/IMG_1126.HEIC)
